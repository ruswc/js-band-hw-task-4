> Our PoC looks nice for the client and we should start preparation for the project development. We should define quality processes and tools and prepare our project for effective development.


### Objectives
- Add eslint to our project
- Add commitizen tool to improve commit messages and log history
- Add and setup Jest for implementing autotest
- Add Webpack config for dev prod and common
- Describe application launch process and commands what we have
- Describe structure of our project

**Implemented:**
- "Eslint" added
- "Commitizen" added. The repository is made "commitizen friendly"

**To run Eslint:**

- to fix the errors automatically, add the *--fix* flag

**example:**
> eslint src --fix

**To run commit via *commitizen*:**
- run the command *git cz* in the terminal
- Following the prompts in the terminal and using the cursor keys, select the settings you want for the future commit
- Following the prompts in the terminal add a description of the fields that you think are necessary

**example:**
> git cz
